<!-- So...I had a few issues going through this. A lot of it was me forgetting basic logic for if statements and  -->
<!-- not having bounds checks. Once I did that, my issues dwindled. -->
<!-- I had some issues with how you were recommending we went about our math. -->
<!-- First: I had no clue how to implement the 75% of the radius thing. It broke my program every time I tried it. -->
<!-- it works great without it so whatever, right? No big deal -->
<!-- Second major issue: When I got theta using / Math.Random()*360 / I guess I was suppose to convert it by -->
<!-- multiplying by pi and dividing by 180. Well..that also totally ****** my fractual generation. -->
<!-- I have the code still there that did it but commented out if you would like to see what I mean -->
<!-- Once it was removed the generator worked without a single issue. Again, I DONT EVEN KNOW. -->

<!-- I don't know how interesting making multiple objects is but that made this program go so much smoother -->
<!-- I've seen people throwing EVERYTHING into a single object. BARF!! BARF!! BARF!! :(    -->
<!-- I did enjoy how I checked surrounding points for a neighbor. That was interesting to me. -->

<!-- I used http://www.w3schools.com/ to get a lot of my referencing material along with the code from your notes -->

<!-- I didn't collaberate with anyone but Aarron has code that is similar to mine at some place in his program -->
<!-- He needed help figuring out calculations or something -->
